General Notes:
-I know everyone has a specific style/formatting regarding spacing and brackets, etc. If I'm working in an existing
codebase, I do adapt to the existing formatting so everything stays consistent and easy to read.
-I know formal unit testing would be more thorough than just using the test() method in the App class and is valuable to have in a
codebase, especially at an enterprise level. I don't currently have any meaningful experience with unit testing and unit testing
frameworks, but it is something I can and would like to learn.
-The design and organization of this project is all my own. Below I documented everything that I googled for this. When I did fall back
to Google I intentionally steered clear of pages mentioning implementing playing cards so I wouldn't be influenced.
-I'm very comfortable with SVN--everywhere I've worked has used SVN. If you use git, that's definitely something I've wanted to learn
and get comfortable with.

Deck.java:
-I googled how to iterate over enum values for the constructor:

-I googled how to get a random int for the shuffleDeck() method:

Card.java:
-I googled the right playing card term for "Rank" so I could properly differentiate it from "Value"
-I knew I wanted an enum in order to define the available ranks but I did google how to do it:
