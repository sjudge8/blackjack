# blackjack
A blackjack game simulator that follows the below requirements:

Create a program that simulates a basic blackjack game.  You will need to create a normal deck of cards (2-10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace in the four suits.  No jokers), shuffle the deck until it is random and then deal out two cards to four players.  You then will calculate the winner by whoever has the highest hand.  Numbered cards count for the number they are, Jacks, Queens and Kings count for 10 and Aces count for 11.  There is no betting or adding of new cards to the hands.

Play this game three times and I’d like output to the console showing each player’s hand and the overall winner for each game.
